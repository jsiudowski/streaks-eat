            <IonCardContent>This project was developed to satisfy the requirements of CS-4700 which is the Computer Science Major Capstone course. During this course, students are split into groups and are given a client which designates a project for them to work on over the course of the semester. For this project, our client was the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion at John Carroll University. Specifically, we met with Ay≈üe Selen Zarrelli, the director of the Center of Student Diversity and Inclusion at John Carroll University. The initial request Selen had was to reduce food insecurity and food waste across campus. This app is the result of our semester-long endeavor to make her idea a reality.</IonCardContent>
